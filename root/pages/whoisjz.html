					<p class="paragraph">	I am a Philadelphia based artist, web developer, and writer. I am currently attending Drexel University as an Interactive Digital Media major. If you found this website, I probably know you, or I am seeking employment from you. If you’re looking for Jordan Zagerman of Ottawa, try JordanZagerman.com. Either way, thank you for checking it out. One of my goals for this website is to display work I have done within my community. To make websites for small businesses, and get first hand experience while I’m still in college. As of the 12/13/2017 I haven’t finished developing any other active websites besides this one. That’s why you won’t find any links just yet. However, I do have one project in the works, that I plan to finish before the new year.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p class="paragraph">	Other than that, I want this website to drive me to do more. I want to be able to incorporate my radio show into this site, when it gets on the air. I want this website to drive me to become more fluid in Adobe Photoshop, and Illustrator. Eventually, I want to sell clothing that features digital art I’ve made, through this site. If nothing else, I want this website to push me to expand my creativity into unfamiliar fields.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p class="paragraph">	I am going to put new content up every week. I don’t know what form that work will be in, but I know eventually I am going to start writing about my thoughts. As a personal favor to a friend of mine. It is going to get pretty weird. Thanks again for visiting.</p>

					<p class="question">Q: Why did you make a website?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: I initially made a website to complete an assignment for my Web Design I course in the fall of 2017.</p>
					<br>

					<p class="question">Q: What is your goal with this website?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: The goal is to display work that I am proud of, and motivate me to do work worthy of sharing.</p>
					<br>

					<p class="question">Q: What type of work are you going to display?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: Ideally I am going to display websites I’ve designed for local businesses, as well as the story behind those sites. However, I am not going to limit this website to just that type of work. In short, I am going to display whatever I’m proud of.</p>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h3 class="subHeader">Donations</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="question">Q: Why do you give visitors so many opportunities to donate to you?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: At first I did it because I thought it was funny, and unique for a portfolio website. I left it because I legitimately do not want to keep paying out of pocket to keep a .com domain name. However, I also wanted to give people the chance to keep the site afloat. In other words, I wanted to see if I could follow the Wikipedia model, and create something that people liked enough to donate.</p>
					<br>

					<p class="question">Q: What are you going to do with the donations?</p>
					<p class="answer">A: I am going to use all of the donations to pay for the domain hosting fees.</p>
					<br>

					<p class="question">Q: Has anyone donated yet?</p>
					<p class="question">A: No, but if and when people do, I will update this answer if they want to be recognized.</p>
